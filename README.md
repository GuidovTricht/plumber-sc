# Plumber for Sitecore Commerce

Plumber is a configuration viewer for Sitecore Commerce, a bit like `showconfig.aspx` in Sitecore but with built-in search capabilities.

## What do you use it for?

Checking what happens in Sitecore Commerce can sometimes be a bit complicated. This tool will give you insight into how the pipelines are configured, which blocks are used and how the policies are configured per environment.

## Installing Plumber

There are two ways to install Plumber:

### Using IIS

The `dist` folder contains a pre-compiled version of Plumber that you can install as an IIS site.

### In development mode

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
